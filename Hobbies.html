        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>
            My programming hobby has been an exhilarating journey of creativity and problem-solving.
            Through coding, I've been able to bring my ideas to life, whether it's developing innovative
            applications or designing efficient algorithms. It's a constantly evolving field that keeps me
            intellectually stimulated and continuously pushes me to learn and explore new technologies.

        <h1>Mixed martial arts</h1>
        <p>
            Mixed martial arts (MMA) training has been an exhilarating and transformative experience for me.
            The physical and mental demands of this discipline have pushed me beyond my limits, helping me
            develop strength, agility, and discipline. Through MMA, I've gained a profound sense of self-confidence
            and self-defense skills.

            Chess has become my beloved hobby, providing me with endless hours of strategic thinking and intellectual stimulation.
            I cherish the mental challenges it presents, constantly pushing me to improve my analytical skills and
            decision-making abilities.
